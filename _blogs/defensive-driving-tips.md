Defensive driving is about staying alert, anticipating potential hazards, and being prepared to react safely to the unexpected. Here are five essential techniques every driver should master.

## 1. Maintain Safe Following Distance

The 3-second rule is your first line of defense:
- Pick a fixed object ahead (like a sign or tree)
- Count the seconds from when the car ahead passes it until you do
- Maintain at least 3 seconds in normal conditions
- Increase to 4-6 seconds in poor weather or heavy traffic

## 2. Scan Constantly for Hazards

Keep your eyes moving and scan:
- 12-15 seconds ahead in city driving
- 20-30 seconds ahead on highways
- Check mirrors every 5-8 seconds
- Watch for pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles

## 3. Position Yourself Strategically

Smart positioning can prevent many accidents:
- Avoid staying in other drivers' blind spots
- Create escape routes whenever possible
- Stay away from clusters of vehicles when you can
- Use the blocking position on multi-lane roads

## 4. Manage Speed for Conditions

Speed limits are for ideal conditions - adjust for:
- Weather conditions (rain, snow, fog)
- Traffic density
- Road construction
- Your own alertness level

## 5. Stay Alert and Focused

Your mental state affects your driving:
- Get adequate rest before long trips
- Avoid driving when emotionally upset
- Put away distractions like phones
- Take breaks every 2 hours on long journeys

## Practice Makes Perfect

These defensive driving techniques become second nature with practice. Start implementing one technique at a time until it becomes automatic, then move on to the next.

Remember: You can't control other drivers, but you can control your response to them. Stay alert, be prepared, and always prioritize safety over convenience.
