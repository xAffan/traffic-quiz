title: Weather Driving Conditions Quiz
description: Test your knowledge of safe driving techniques in various weather conditions
difficulty: medium
questions:
  - question: "When driving in heavy rain, you should:"
    options:
      - "Increase speed to get through it quickly"
      - "Use cruise control to maintain steady speed"
      - "Reduce speed and increase following distance"
      - "Drive in the left lane only"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "In heavy rain, reduce speed, increase following distance, and avoid sudden movements that could cause hydroplaning."

  - question: "Hydroplaning occurs when:"
    options:
      - "Your tires are over-inflated"
      - "Water builds up between tires and road surface"
      - "You drive too slowly in rain"
      - "Your windshield wipers are too fast"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Hydroplaning happens when water builds up between tires and road, causing loss of traction and control."

  - question: "If you start to hydroplane, you should:"
    options:
      - "Brake firmly"
      - "Accelerate to regain traction"
      - "Ease off the gas and steer straight"
      - "Turn the wheel sharply"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "If hydroplaning, ease off the gas, avoid sudden movements, and steer straight until you regain traction."

  - question: "In snowy conditions, the best way to stop is to:"
    options:
      - "Pump the brakes rapidly"
      - "Apply steady, gentle pressure to brakes"
      - "Use the parking brake"
      - "Downshift and brake hard"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "In snow, apply steady, gentle brake pressure. If you have ABS, let the system do the work. If not, pump gently."

  - question: "When driving in fog, you should:"
    options:
      - "Use high beam headlights"
      - "Use low beam headlights and fog lights"
      - "Use only fog lights"
      - "Drive without lights to reduce glare"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "In fog, use low beam headlights and fog lights. High beams reflect off fog and reduce visibility."

  - question: "Black ice is most likely to form:"
    options:
      - "During heavy snowstorms"
      - "On bridges, overpasses, and shaded areas"
      - "Only on dirt roads"
      - "In the middle of sunny days"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Black ice typically forms on bridges, overpasses, and shaded areas where temperatures drop first."

  - question: "When driving in strong crosswinds, you should:"
    options:
      - "Speed up to maintain control"
      - "Keep a firm grip on steering wheel and reduce speed"
      - "Drive in the center of your lane only"
      - "Use cruise control"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "In strong winds, maintain a firm grip, reduce speed, and be prepared for sudden gusts that can push your vehicle."

  - question: "If you get stuck in snow, you should:"
    options:
      - "Gun the engine to spin out"
      - "Rock the vehicle gently back and forth"
      - "Keep the wheels straight and floor it"
      - "Turn the wheels to full lock"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "If stuck, rock gently between forward and reverse, using gradual acceleration to avoid spinning wheels."

  - question: "Winter tires should be used when temperatures are consistently below:"
    options:
      - "32°F (0°C)"
      - "45°F (7°C)"
      - "25°F (-4°C)"
      - "50°F (10°C)"
    correct: 1
    explanation: "Winter tires are designed for temperatures below 45°F (7°C) when regular tire rubber becomes less flexible."

  - question: "When driving in heavy snow, you should:"
    options:
      - "Follow other vehicles closely for guidance"
      - "Use 4-wheel drive at high speeds"
      - "Increase following distance to 8-10 seconds"
      - "Drive only in the left lane"
    correct: 2
    explanation: "In snow, dramatically increase following distance to 8-10 seconds to allow for longer stopping distances."
